Flee hopping
************

I came across this interesting programming challenge, which I thought would be nice
to implement as a way to learn and see how it could be done on different languages. The setup is like this:

- We have a 15 x 15 board
- On each square there sits a flee
- Bird flies over, which causes the flees to jump randomly to one of the nearby squares
* flees will always jump i.e. they can't stay put
* flees can't jump from one edge of the board to another i.e. only to the middle of the board
- What is the distrubution of flees on squares on different times

For now I have implemented the logic with following languages:
- Perl (This was the original implementation)
- HTML5 / Javascript

Next I am planning to port it at least to these languages:
- Python
- Visual C#
- Java
- Ruby
